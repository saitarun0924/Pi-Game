# Pi-Game
As part of Internship, we developed a project to develop a game using python, it is similar to the snake game but with PI theme.

REQUIREMENTS:

We need to install some packages to runs this program:
1) pip install getkey
2) pip install cursor
3) pip install threaded

OBSERVATIONS:

1) So basically after running the program we get the game on the output dialog box.
2) Where we can use W-A-S-D or ←↕→ to move.
3) Where the 'π' acts as a snake and all the digits in Pi values acts food for the snake.
